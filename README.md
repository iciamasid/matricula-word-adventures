## Mobile App Development (Android APK)

This project is configured for mobile app development using Capacitor.

### ðŸš€ **NEW: Local Build Process (Recommended)**

You can now build the Android APK locally on your machine for better control and faster builds.

#### Quick Start (Local Build)

1. **Check your environment:**
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   ./check-environment.sh
   
   # Windows
   check-environment.bat
   ```

2. **Build the APK:**
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   ./build-local.sh
   
   # Windows
   build-local.bat
   ```

3. **Install the APK:**
   - Your APK will be at: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
   - Install on device: `adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

#### Prerequisites for Local Build

- **Node.js 18+** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Java 17 JDK** - [Download here](https://adoptium.net/)
- **Android Studio** - [Download here](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)

For detailed setup instructions, see **[LOCAL_BUILD_GUIDE.md](LOCAL_BUILD_GUIDE.md)**.

### GitHub Codespaces Build (Alternative)

If you prefer to use GitHub Codespaces, the environment will be automatically configured. The setup includes:
- Node.js and npm dependencies
- Android SDK and build tools
- Capacitor Android platform

#### Manual Codespaces Setup

If the automatic setup fails:

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x setup-android.sh build-apk.sh

# Run the setup script
./setup-android.sh
```

#### Building the APK in Codespaces

After setup is complete:

```bash
# Build the APK
./build-apk.sh
```

### Manual Setup (Any Environment)

If you want to set up manually:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build web app
npm run build

# Add Android platform (first time only)
npx cap add android

# Sync project
npx cap sync android

# Build APK
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **Java not found**: Install Java 17 and set JAVA_HOME
- **Android SDK not found**: Install Android Studio and set ANDROID_HOME
- **Licenses not accepted**: Run `sdkmanager --licenses`
- **Build fails**: Try `./gradlew clean assembleDebug`

**Need Help?**
- Check [LOCAL_BUILD_GUIDE.md](LOCAL_BUILD_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions
- Run environment check scripts to diagnose issues
- Ensure all prerequisites are properly installed

### Requirements for Local Development

To build locally, you need:
- Node.js 18+
- Java 17 JDK
- Android Studio (with SDK)
- Git

The local build process is now the recommended approach for building Android APKs as it provides:
- âœ… Better error handling and debugging
- âœ… Faster build times
- âœ… More control over the build environment
- âœ… Detailed progress feedback
- âœ… Comprehensive environment validation
